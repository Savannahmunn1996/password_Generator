# password_Generator

## Description

I was motivated to make this project because it was an assignment that would be beneficial to my programming journey. I feel that I learned a lot from it. It is a simple application that allows a user to input choices and generate a unique, random password with a minimum of 8 characters.

## Usage

To use it, the user must first input the length that they want their password to be (the minimum is 8), then they must choose from the other options on the list that are in the form of checkboxes. after this they must click the generate password button and a unique password will appear on the screen for them.

## Features

An easy to use interface with input box and checkboxes. A functioning generate password button. It generates random passwords based on input from the user.
